Placing high dimensional data into low-dimensional space without losing much of the information is the fundamental principle of doing cluster analysis. Some of the important techniques that are used to do dimensionality reduction are Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Stochastic neighbour embedding (SNE). This source code gives the comparison between of SNE and PCA on MNIST dataset.
